API Changes between 1.x and 2.x:

* [START-UDP-SERVER] Second argument of UDP-SERVER-LOOP changed

  Now we bind UDP client's address and port to special variable:
	*client-address*, *client-port*, and simply UDP-SERVER-LOOP's
	second arguent to ftype: (function (sequence) sequence). So we
	can just use #'identity to implement a UDP echo server:

  (COMM:START-UDP-SERVER :FUNCTION #'IDENTITY ...)

* [START-UDP-SERVER] New :ARGUMENTS keyword

	Now START-UDP-SERVER has a new :ARGUMENTS keyword, you can pass values into
	this keyword argument as LIST, and these values will be called with your
	UDP message processing function.

API Changes between 2.x and 3.x:

* [SYNC-MESSAGE] High-level UDP message send/recv function with
	retransmit support.
